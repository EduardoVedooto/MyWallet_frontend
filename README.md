## About

- This is a simple, yet really useful, app that helps you to manage your finances the best way possible. Its interface is straightfoward, which is a good thing, so you don't need to much time to undestand how to use. Just open your app, create an account, and starting adding your new incomes and expenses. Simple right?

## Motivations to delevop this project

- This app was made through my journey to become a fullstack web developer, and it was one the most increadible projects that I've made so far. I loved the concept of it, which is help people in something that is somewhat hard to do (to manage finances). It was really challeging in some parts to delevelop though, especially to work with both frontend and [backend](https://github.com/EduardoVedooto/MyWallet_backend). But I'm very proud of it in the end.
- During its implementation I was able to improve my skills in Styled-components, React Router and learn more about best practices to develop a React App

## Functionalities

- Create an account
- Login and logout
- Add a new income
- Add a new expense

## Next steps
